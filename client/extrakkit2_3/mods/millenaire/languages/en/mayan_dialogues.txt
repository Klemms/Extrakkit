v1;0;Stone is the best material to ever exist. 
v2;30; It's even better when cooked! Hurray for stone! 
v1;60;We need to mine it! To work! 

newchat;key:pyramid,building:mayanpyramid,weigth:7
v1;0;Our pyramid is the most beautiful and the best built. 
v2;30;It's true. I visited other villages. Theirs are very nice but not elegant like ours! 
v1;60;Our architecture is unique and original.  
v2;90;Don't boast too much. I don't want us to be like the vain Byzantines. 
v1;120;Oh yes, uhhh... I hate them. How could anyone be so pretentious! 

newchat;key:player,weigth:10
v1;0;We don't get many visitors here. 
v2;30;Yeah, there is only $name and other lost people... 
v1;60;Speaking of $name, don't you find him to be increasingly strange, and tired? 
v2;90;True. He should take some rest. 

newchat;key:miner,weigth:9
v1;0;We should recruit more miners. 
v2;30;Ah yes! The rocks and minerals are the best materials in existance. 
v1;60;I agree... but there are not enough of us in the village, our numbers must grow. 
v2;90;And we can't put the children to work. They're too young. 

newchat;key:woman,weigth:6,v1:adult,v2:adult,v1:female

v2;30;But you did that yesterday! 
v1;60;Regardless, I am not allowed to do anything else here. 
v2;90;You always complain! 
v1;120;Instead of protesting about me complaining, try to understand why I'm complaining! 

newchat;key:friend,v1:vtype:mayan_miner,v2:adult,weigth:10
v1;0;Ah my good friend $targetfirstname! How do you do? 
v2;30;Hello $targetfirstname! Doing what I can really, Buisness is bad. 
v1;60;Have you stopped selling stone to the Hindis? 
v2;90;Yes. Now that independant Japanese miners offered their services, they don't need me anymore. 
v1;120;You just have to offer them something else. 
v2;150;You have any ideas? 

newchat;key:monster,weigth:5
v1;0;There are a lot of monsters out now. 
v2;30;I'm sure the guards can fight them. 
v1;60;What worries me is if a hoard of those explosive green creatures comes to attack. 
v2;90;Worry not. We have decoys to use against them. 
v1;120;Okay, at worst there is $name. He fights well and could defend us.  
v2;150;I don't doubt it either. He's not that bad. 

newchat;key:normands,weigth:6
v1;0;Have you seen the skin color of the Normans? There all so pale! 
v2;30;Oh yes! I have never seen such a color before. It's strange.  
v1;60;I think they may have been cursed... 
v2;90;Don't be silly. They are human just like everyone else. 
v1;120;It's without a doubt alcohol that changed them like that. I'm sure they weren't always that way. 
v2;150;You are probably wrong. 

newchat;key:alchimist,weigth:4
v1;0;When exploring the forest, i saw a funny alchemist. 
v2;30;You seen him too? He is ridiculously weird. 
v1;60;And how. There was a list of strange ingredients. Do you know what "withered skeleton skulls?" or "soul sand" is? 
v2;90;No. but it's not very reassuring. 
v1;120;Yeah! We think he's trying to make a Philosopher Stone. 
v2;150;Brave $targetfirstname, if you believe in rumors, you are at risque of believing the Earth is round. 
v1;180;You are probably right. 

newchat;key:dragonegg,v1:adult,v2:adult,weigth:5

v1;60;It was big with violet spots. Very Big. 
v2;90;Did you drink Norman alcohol again or are you joking? 
v1;120;But... Its true! I swear! 
v2;150;Haha! If you think you can trick me like that, you're wrong! 

newchat;key:wither,weigth:3
v1;0;In the forest i saw a strange black creature.

v1;60;Well it was a black skeleton like creature, with two heads at the end of its arms and one on its neck, and it had a look as cold as ice... 
v2;90;That sends chills down my spine. 
v1;120;Endermen were attacking it. 
v2;150;Endermen? They don't exist, you must have been dreaming. 

newchat;key:bakery,notbuilding:mayanbakery,weigth:7
v1;0;We should build a bakery. It would put us in buisness.

v1;60;Let's go talk to the chief. 

newchat;key:bestdad,v1:child,v2:child,weigth:8
v1;0;My father is the best because he is a lumberman!

v1;60;Without wood, your dad serves no purpose. 
v2;90;Oh yeah!? You looking for one?! 
v1;120;Stop, the stone is useless, admit it. 
v2;150;Without stone, your dad would be sleeping under the stars!

v2;90;It's beautiful and effective. Was it expensive? 
v1;120;Hell yes! I wasted two silver coins on the bow alone ! 
v2;150;Whoa! You would have to save a lot before buying them. 

newchat;key:exchange,v1:adult,v2:adult,v1:male,v2:male,weigth:9

v1;60;Six Days. My dogs are not sufficient to provide me enough protection. 
v2;90;Alright, A silver coin. No less. 
v1;120;That's robbery! 
v2;150;Not at all, $targetfirstname. I'm risking my life in this job. 

newchat;key:cereal,v2:vtype:mayan_farmer,weigth:9

v2;90;And? 
v1;120;Lightning struck and... He stood up on his hind legs... 
v2;150;Really?! What did it look like? 
v1;180;It had green mold on it.. or something like that. and had a gold sword too. 
v2;210;Did you attack or flee? 
v1;240;I was unarmed. but it didn't want to attack me. It looked at me, turned it's head and wandered off without really knowing what was going on. 
v2;270;You should have used fire. What if it attacks the village? 
v1;300;It was impervious to fire, Lightning struck it again and it felt nothing. 

newchat;key:recolt,weigth:10
v1;0;The harvest is plentiful this year.

v1;60;But where did he come from? 
v2;90;Not sure, he doesn't seem to be from any culture. 


newchat;key:byzantins,weigth:9

v1;0;Becoming a Warrior was the best decision of my life. 
v2;30;How come?

v1;0;The Indians seem much more peaceful than the Normans don't they ?

newchat;key:gravity,weigth:7

v1;60;Except for gravel... and the sand. 
v2;90;I wonder why ? 

newchat;key:obsidian,v1:vtype:mayan_obsidiancrafter,weigth:8
